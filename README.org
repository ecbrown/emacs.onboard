* ONBOARD â€“ Portable Emacs config without any 3rd-party packages

The goal of this Emacs config is to offer a clean slate to build upon.
It stays as close as possible to vanilla Emacs, but offers some convenience
and a better look, without relying on other packages than the built-ins.


** Getting started

*** New Emacs user without own config files?

1. Download init-onboard.el
2. Rename it to .emacs
3. Move it to your home directory and start Emacs
